# SciMLLogging.jl

A verbosity control system for the SciML ecosystem that provides fine-grained control over logging and messaging in scientific computing workflows.

## Features

- **Fine-grained control**: Control individual aspects of logging with specific verbosity settings
- **Type-safe interface**: Leverage Julia's type system for compile-time safety  
- **Zero-cost abstraction**: Disabled verbosity has no runtime overhead
- **Integration with Julia's logging**: Built on top of Julia's standard logging infrastructure

## Installation

To install SciMLLogging, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SciMLLogging")
```
